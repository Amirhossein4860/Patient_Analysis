ü©∫ Patient Outcome Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

Overview

Welcome to the Patient Outcome Prediction repository! This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to predict patient outcomes based on a comprehensive set of environmental and lifestyle features. With a focus on real-world applications in healthcare, this repository offers a powerful framework for classifying patients and recommending appropriate care pathways, from safe monitoring to immediate hospital referral.

Key Features
üîç Outlier Detection & Data Cleaning: Includes robust methods for detecting and handling outliers using statistical techniques like Interquartile Range (IQR), threshold-based filtering, and frequency analysis, ensuring high-quality input data for reliable predictions.

üå≥ Environmental & Lifestyle Data Analysis: Provides in-depth analysis of environmental and lifestyle factors, helping to understand their impact on patient health outcomes. The project emphasizes the critical role of environmental data in predictive modeling.

üå≤ Random Forest Classifier: Implements a powerful Random Forest model built with Decision Trees to classify patients based on their environmental data. This model is optimized to deliver high accuracy in predicting patient classes, such as safe, primary care, or hospital referral.

üìä Feature Importance Visualization: Visualizes feature importance to offer insights into which environmental factors are most influential in patient outcome predictions, enhancing interpretability and decision-making.

üîÑ Simulation Tool: Features a simulation function that takes real-time patient data as input and predicts the required care level, providing actionable recommendations such as "Safe," "Modified Care," "Primary Care," or "Hospital" based on the model's output.

üìà Model Evaluation & Comparison: Includes detailed reports on the performance of different classifiers (Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.) across various datasets, offering a comparative analysis to identify the most effective models.
